project_2 is realised server-client model with blockchain protol.
server is accepting clients who can send requests.
requests are adding new transaction(add new block in a chain), checking the chain  integrity  and closing the client session.
the chain is realised as sequence of text files.

1. Write 3 files with blockchain, server and client
2. in block.py create function what addes a block to chain
3. create function with check integrity (check hash in files and calculete hash and equal both)
4. cretate server what accepts new clients and create thread for each client for requesting on client's request
5. create client who can add block, check integrity and quit
6. create processing for close client's socket in server when client come out sesion
7. create request for close server
